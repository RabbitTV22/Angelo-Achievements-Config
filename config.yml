# AngeloAchievements is a plugin focused on customizing the default Minecraft advancements.
# I RECOMMEND using the command '/gamerule announceAdvancements false' so that the default messages
# don't bother you, and you can enjoy only the customized messages from the plugin.

# The function of 'default_message' is to provide a default message that will be shown for all advancements
# if they do not have a specific configuration under the 'achievements:' section.
# If an advancement has a specific type configured under 'achievements:', the default message will be ignored
# for that advancement, and the customized message will be shown instead.

# AngeloAchievements supports MiniMessage, HEX, and RGB colors, allowing you to customize messages with great flexibility.

# Section to customize specific advancements:
# You can name the entries under 'achievements:' however you like; the name does not affect the plugin's functionality.
# Make sure to set the advancement type with 'type', followed by its Minecraft path (e.g., minecraft:story/mine_diamond).

# Example configuration for advancements:
# achievements:
#   Achievement1:  ⬅ This name is free; you can change it to whatever you want.
#     type: minecraft:story/mine_diamond  ⬅ The type of advancement you want to customize.
#     message:  ⬅ The messages that will be sent upon completing this advancement.
#       - "<blue>You have completed the advancement <yellow>Mine a Diamond&"
#       - "<green>Congratulations!"
#   Achievement2:
#     type: minecraft:adventure/kill_a_mob
#     message:
#       - "<gradient:#ff0000:#00ff00>You have completed the achievement First Blood!</gradient>"
#       - "<red><bold>Incredible!"
#     title: "You completed an achievement"  ⬅ Title that will appear on the player's screen.
#     subtitle: "Check the chat"  ⬅ Subtitle that will appear on the player's screen.
#     hover:  ⬅ Messages that will appear when the player hovers over the chat message.
#       - "<gray>You killed your first mob!"
#       - "<gold>Good job!"
#     commands:  ⬅ Commands that will execute upon completing the achievement. Use '%player%' for the player's name.
#       - "give %player% diamond 1"
#       - "[BROCAST] %player% has killed their first mob!" ⬅ Broadcasts a message to all players.

# Default message that will be shown if an achievement does not have a specific configuration.
default_message: "<green>%player% has earned the achievement %achievements%!"
